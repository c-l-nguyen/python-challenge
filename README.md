# python-challenge

This project contains two Python challenges to demonstrate use of the CSV module: **PyBank** and **PyPoll**, which both read in CSV files, summarizes them, and then outputs results to both the terminal and to a CSV file. 

## Contents
- **/PyBank**: contains Python code to analyze the financial records of a fictional company. Also contains Jupyter Notebook used for scratchwork and for testing code part by part.
    - **/Resources**: contains input (*budget_data.csv*) and output CSVs
- **/PyPoll**: contains Python code to count votes for candidates for a fictional local election. Also contains Jupyter Notebook used for scratchwork and for testing code part by part.
    - **/Resources**: contains input (*election_data.csv*) and output CSVs

## Directions
Run the main.py program in both directories using `python main.py` (or something similar in your unit testing). The results are output in the terminal and are saved in the **/Resources** directory in both sections as *output.csv*.
